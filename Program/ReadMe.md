Within the sum of squares (WSS), also known as the sum of squared errors (SSE), is a measure of the variability of data within clusters in a clustering algorithm such as k-means clustering. It is the sum of the squared Euclidean distances between each data point and its assigned cluster centroid.

When we perform k-means clustering, we first initialize k cluster centroids and assign each data point to its nearest centroid. We then update the centroids by calculating the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster. This process is repeated until the centroids converge to a stable position.

The WSS is calculated as the sum of the squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid, summed over all data points and all clusters. In other words, it represents the total amount of variability in the data that is not accounted for by the cluster centroids.

The WSS is an important metric in k-means clustering because it is used to evaluate the quality of a clustering solution. The goal of k-means clustering is to minimize the WSS, which means that we want to find cluster centroids that are as close as possible to the data points assigned to them. The optimal number of clusters can be determined by using methods like the elbow method, which involves plotting the WSS against the number of clusters and selecting the point at which the rate of decrease in WSS starts to level off (the "elbow point").


/***************************************/
The algorithm for calculating the elbow value is as follows:

The SSE (sum of squared errors) values for each number of clusters are calculated using the k-means algorithm.
A plot is generated using the SSE values as the y-axis and the number of clusters as the x-axis.
The slope and intercept of a line connecting the first and last points on the plot are calculated.
The distance between each SSE value and the predicted value on the line is calculated.
The elbow point is chosen as the point with the smallest distance to the predicted value on the line.

FC-Means clustering can be applied to a variety of data sets where the boundaries between clusters are not well-defined. 
To apply FC-Means clustering to Company.xlsx data set, we would first need to normalize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. We would then choose a value for the fuzziness parameter (typically denoted as m), which determines how fuzzy the clustering will be. A higher value of m leads to fuzzier clustering.
NOTE:
#Choose the number of clusters (K) and the fuzzifier (m):
The fuzzifier determines the degree of fuzziness of the clusters. A typical value for m is 2.
The number of clusters can be determined using methods such as the elbow method.

1. Compute the membership values for each customer in each cluster, using the fuzzy c-means algorithm.
#Calculate the membership value (U) for each observation in each cluster using the following formula:
U(i,j) = 1 / [SUM(k=1 to K)[(D(i,j)/D(i,k))^(2/(m-1))]]
where i is the observation index, j is the cluster index, k is the cluster index, K is the number of clusters, D(i,j) is the distance between observation i and cluster center j, and m is the fuzzifier.

We would then initialize the cluster centers randomly and iterate through the following steps until convergence:
2. Update the cluster centers based on the new membership values.
Calculate the new cluster centers based on the membership values and the original data using the f#ollowing formula:
C(j) = [SUM(i=1 to N)[(U(i,j)^m)*X(i)]] / [SUM(i=1 to N)[(U(i,j)^m)]]
where j is the cluster index, i is the observation index, N is the total number of observations, X(i) is the data for observation i, and m is the fuzzifier.
3. Check for convergence (i.e., whether the cluster centers have stopped changing).

After convergence, we would have a set of cluster centers and the corresponding membership values for each customer. We could then assign each customer to the cluster with the highest membership value and analyze the results.
